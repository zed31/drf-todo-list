# TODO List API

This project consist of creating an API using Django Rest Framework technology. The goal of this API is to provide a business logic related to a
todo list.

# How it works

Todolist API have 2 main objects:
- TODO: Which is represented by a title and a description and an owner
- User: Which is represented by an email and a password which can be either a normal user and an administrator

## User side

An user can do the following things
- Perform CRUD operation on its own profile
- Perform CRUD operation on todo

## Administrator side

An administrator can do the following things:
- Perform CRUD operation on user
- Perform CRUD operation on todo
- Ban an user by updating its pofile

## Todo

Todo are objects without logic on it, basically a todo contains just the following fields:

| Field       | Description                  | Type       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| title       | The title of the todo        | CharField  |
| description | The description of the todo  | TextField  |
| owner       | The owner (User) of the task | ForeignKey |
| status      | Status of the todo           | Choice     |

The following value applies to the Todo status:

| Status | Value       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| C      | Created     |
| P      | In progress |
| D      | Done        |

## User

User are objects that allows you to authenticate through session authentication or even register
and access to your todo, the following fields compose the user:

| Field        | Description                                                                  | Type         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| email        | The email used by the user to register or authenticate, must be unique       | EmailField   |
| password     | The password used by the user to register or authenticate                    | CharField    |
| is_superuser | Boolean used to detect if the user is an administrator or a regular user     | BooleanField |
| is_ban       | Boolean used to detect if the user is ban or not                             | BooleanField |

# Install the API

## Install manually

To install it, just clone the repository and run the following command:

`pip install -r <TODOLIST_REPOSITORY>/requirements.txt`

Or you can create a virtualenv like this:

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd <TODOLIST_REPOSITORY>
pip install -r <TODOLIST_REPOSITORY>/requirements.txt

#Make sure everything worked:
cd <TODOLIST_REPOSITORY>
python3 manage.py test
```

Just replace the `TODOLIST_REPOSITORY` by the actual repository

**Make sure you have python3 installed**

## With docker

You can simply use docker-compose by running the following command:
```sh
git clonet <REPO>
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

# Run the server

To run the server simply use: `python3 manage.py runserver`

# Routes

In all paths containing a `PK`, replace the `PK` by the primary key

# Request examples

## Registration example

To register a new user just do the following request to the api:

Make a `post` request on the route `/api/<api_version>/auth/register/`

Header:
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:
```json
{
    "email": "foo.bar@gmail.com",
    "password": "secret_password"
}
```
## Login example

The login (if succeed) will return you the things you can do once you are logged in (i.e: All the route you can access). Login will also provides 2 things inside the cookies:
- The session id used to determine your session
- The CSRF token to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery

Make a `post` request on the route `/api/<api_version>/auth/login/`

Header:
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:
```json
{
    "email": "foo.bar@gmail.com",
    "password": "secret_password"
}
```

## Create a todo

To create a todo you first need to create a session by login to the API, then execute a `post` request on the following route: `/api/<api_version>/todo/`

Header
```
Content-Type: application/json
XCSRF-Token: <generated_token>
```

Body
```json
{
    "title": "title of the todo",
    "description" : "description of the todo"
}
```
